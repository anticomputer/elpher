Preparing a new Release
=======================

When preparing a new release, set the version number:

1. in config.mk:     VERSION variable
2. in elpher.el:     metadata at the top
3. in elpher.el:     definition of elpher-version
4. in elpher-pkg.el: second argument to 'define-package'

For anything besides a patch release, a note describing
the changes should be added to the documentation.  In
the instance that the documentation itself is significantly
changed, also update the documentation version:

5. in elpher.texi:   'settitle' declaration at the top

After any documentation updates, make sure it builds:

    make elpher.info elpher.html elpher.pdf
